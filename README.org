* Introduction

A friend of mine talked about an imaginary detector that provides
measures as list of integers, and how can we get the average value of
every points.

I used this problem as a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)][kata]] to play with [[http://www.scalatest.org][ScalaTest]] supported
styles.
 
* Requirements

  * [[http://www.openjdk.org][OpenJDK]] or any other modern Java Runtime

  * [[http://www.scala-sbt.org][SBT]]

  * Internet connection [fn:1]
    
* Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
sbt test
#+END_SRC

** Footnotes

[fn:1] Welcome to the XXI century, we use Ivy as dependency
   management, and ideally you should only need scalatest. But as I
   said, that's in an ideal world.
